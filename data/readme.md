# Data

*Note*: this folder contains data for testing purposes. You don't have to use any of it.

`data.json` contains mock data that you can import to the database when the site is complete:

```
python manage.py loaddata data/data.json
```

You can copy the `media_files` folder to the project root and rename it as `media` after you have imported the data so you don't have to upload images manually. 

`images` contains some images that you can use for the project.

`lorem.txt` contains a dummy text that you can copy paste to content fields.

# Configuration files

`local_settings_prod.py` contains settings used in the production environment.
